## Minimal
It contains just the necessary to get started with React, I decided to not include flux libraries or other complicated stuff like server-rendering in here.

This projects aims to be a starting point for your React projects, and a way to learn it for newcomers.

See a [working demo](http://vesparny.github.io/react-kickstart/)

## Features
* webpack and webpack-dev-server setup for development (with hot-module-replacement), and for production (with sourcemaps generation for both css and js bundles)
* clear separation between [smart and dumb components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0)
* styles for dumb components directly loaded from inside the component file
* basic routing setup with react-router (you most likely need routing in your app)
* code written is ES6 syntax and transpiled with [babeljs](https://babeljs.io/)
* unit tests ([mocha](http://mochajs.org/) + [chai](http://chaijs.com/)) examples with both [shallow-rendering](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html#shallow-rendering) and [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom)
* code coverage generation using [istanbul](https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/)
* eslint and jscs configuration
